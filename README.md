# TheSamBuilds
👋 Hi there! Welcome to my dev journey.

I'm an aspiring self-taught developer on a 100-day journey to master **C programming** and **Data Structures & Algorithms** — building one project at a time ✨

---

### 🎓 Currently Learning:
- C Programming (from scratch)
- Mastering DSA in C
- Git & GitHub (building in public)

### 🌟 100 Days of C + DSA:
```c
for (int day = 1; day <= 100; day++) {
    learn();
    build();
    share();
}
```
Join me on this journey! Follow my daily updates on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheSamBuilds)

### 📊 My Goals:
- ✅ Complete C + DSA base in 100 days
- ✨ Move to Python and start AI/ML Projects
- 💼 Land freelance projects & internships
- 🚀 Build a powerful dev portfolio
